# FARI Digital Twin Asset Library

A web application for managing and visualizing 3D assets and geospatial data for a digital twin. This project provides a user-friendly interface to upload, browse, and view various types of digital twin assets. It is built with Vue 3 and Vite, and it uses libraries like Cesium and Three.js for powerful 2D/3D visualization.

## Features

*   **Asset Management**: Upload, and manage various types of assets:
    *   3D Models (e.g., glTF)
    *   3D Tilesets (e.g., Cesium 3D Tiles)
    *   Point Clouds
    *   Geospatial Map Layers (WMS)
*   **Interactive Viewers**: Each asset type has a dedicated interactive viewer:
    *   A 3D model viewer.
    *   A Cesium-based viewer for 3D tilesets and point clouds.
    *   A 2D map viewer for WMS layers with legend support.
*   **Organized Libraries**: Browse assets in dedicated libraries for maps, 3D tilesets, and point clouds.
